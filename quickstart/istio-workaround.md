## Temporary Istio Workaround

### Istio TLS Connection

If you are using Istio as your gateway provider, apply this temporary workaround.
Currently, the EPP service uses the default self-signed certificates for its internal communication.
Istio's Envoy proxy will terminate the TLS connection because it cannot validate these self-signed certificates.
To resolve this, you can apply an Istio `DestinationRule`. This rule instructs Envoy to initiate a `SIMPLE` TLS
connection to the EPP service but to skip the certificate verification, allowing the connection to succeed.

-----

### Applying the Fix

The following will set the required variables from your deployment and apply the `DestinationRule`.

1.  Set the namespace:

```bash
export EPP_NAMESPACE="llm-d"
```

2.  Find and set the EPP service name:

```bash
export EPP_NAME=$(kubectl get svc -n "${EPP_NAMESPACE}" -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}' | grep -- "-epp" | head -n1)
```

3.  Apply the `DestinationRule`:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -n "${EPP_NAMESPACE}" -f -
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: ${EPP_NAME}-insecure-tls
spec:
  host: ${EPP_NAME}
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      insecureSkipVerify: true
EOF
```
